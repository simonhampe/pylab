Summary of pow-wow on 19.10.2016:

- Room generator in roomtest.py kind of okay as is
- Generate labyrinth in the following manner:
    - Place random squares in map
    - Fill squares with random room generated as above
    - Create random graph between rooms
    - For each edge built a random corridor:
    - The corridor should be winding: Maybe get more goal-oriented as time progresses
    - Generate Nirvana independently
    - For merging: Every wall which lies on the same coordinate as Nirvana becomes Nirvana
    - (in the end, everything becomes Nirvana. 'Cause we don't really care. Fuck you all)

- Next todos:
    - Sebb: Experiment with scrolling and zooming and such things
    - Simon: Goof off. Or do some random labyrinthing. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.

Summary of pow-wow on 13.11.2016:

- Rooms are shit. Redo that. And maybe not with stupid fucking cellular automata... automatotons, auto... ah, fuck it.
- Nirvana generator
- Next goal: Have a figure that can move through the labyrinth (not through walls and nirvana) and find a goal.
    - On goal: Create new labyrinth
    - Do collision testing by finding the <= 4 grid fields that the player sprite can overlap.
